On this react app budget-calculator I am going to use 

useState hook

useEffect hook

React Icons

Forms

Css

// useEffect let's perform side effects
// runs after every render
// first_parameter - callback function (run after render)
// second_parameter - array - for letting react know when to run useEffect
// react re-renders when state has changed or props
